### LDAP Injection Story

In this story we will be provided with a guidance for preventing LDAP injection
flaws in your applications.

An example application (Java 11) simulates user authentication process based on a login/password input and user search process.
For this purpose there is a simple in-memory LDAP server [InMemoryLdapServer](src/main/java/InMemoryLdapServer.java) starts in the application.
The file [users.ldif](src/main/resources/users.ldif) contains sample user's data.

This service uses the simple [LdapClient](src/main/java/LdapClient.java) to connect to the in-memory server.

A test class [LdapInjectionTest](src/test/java/LdapInjectionTest.java) contains tests to check both correct user input and user input for injection.
